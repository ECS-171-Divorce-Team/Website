# Website
Website for the Machine Learning Website


## Main Project Repo:
[ECS-171-Online-Study](https://github.com/ECS-171-Divorce-Team/ECS-171-Online-Study)

## Project Breakdown:
1) Design the Lo-Fi of the page

At this stage we will:
- Explore what should go on the webpage
- The scale of the website
- Member brainstorm and idea to be on the website

> We should always asking for other opinion on how our page should look

2) Design the Hi-Fi of the page

At this stage we will:
- Decide what kind of layout would go well with a Machine Learning showcases webpage
- Solidified the content we want to show on the page.

**The next step will happen concurrently with the previous two**

1) Developing the Front-End for the project
- Using NextJS as skeleton. We implement the Hi-Fi design to a real page.
2) Developing the Back-End for the project
- Find out what backend technology and see if its' fathomable to develop a full backend for our website.

## Running the project
(Copied from the NextJS page)
### Requirement
You will need NodeJS to develop and run our project. Please install the following:
- [Node.js Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
After installing please verified on your machine by typing these on the terminal:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If there isn't any output. Please try restart your computer or re-install Node.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
